# CPP-Project-Work-AISSCE-2013-
Computer Shop System

School project and my first coding project built for AISSCE 2013 (12th board examination). Most of the syntaxes,programming practices,etc in c++ have undergone changes over the years. Hence this code is outdated as of now. I built it at the time when turbo c++ was still popular.
